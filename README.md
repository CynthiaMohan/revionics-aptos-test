## Mock-up

## Requirements

- Do your Best to create a dropdown that looks and functions like the one specified above
- Dropdown must have a binding that will allow you to change the selected option
- Dropdown must have a binding that allows you to change the placeholder label in the default (state when nothingh is selected)
- Dropdown must have a binding that allows you to change the options available in the dropdown menu list.
- Dropdown must emit an event when an option is selected that contains an identifier for the selected value
- If there are more than seven items in the menu , a scrollbar should be shown that allows them to scroll through the options

### Bonus (Nice to have but not required)

- Set up the dropdown so that it has a two-way binding instead of a regular binding. If the dropdown value is changed, the dropdown should reflect the change,but if the user selects something in the dropdown, the value variable should also change automatically.

## Technologies Used

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
